# Static Comp #1

For our first static comp, we had to recreate a given comp using HTML and CSS. We had to respect the integrity of the original comp and started working with Flexbox to create a responsive layout to fit all screen sizes. We were able to take creative liberties with the copy, images, icons, and color palette.

Since we were able to change the color scheme, I decided to go with a turquoise and red theme. I chose an artsy picture that had some burnt orange and blues in it so that it still had some of the same underlying tones as the color scheme I chose. I also went with Raleway, a sans-serif font that is clear to read and has an especially nice "w."

As far as the CSS goes, I used Flexbox to make the boxes stack properly when changing the screen width. I also used Flex within the boxes themselves to make sure that the icons stayed in the center and adapted to the layout.
